# imgToWebp

imgToWebp is a PHP library for converting images (JPG, PNG, WebP) to other formats (webp by default) and resizing them on the fly. 
It provides a modern alternative to the old TimThumb script file, allowing you to easily generate resized version of images in your PHP applications.

## Features

- Convert images to WebP, JPG, or PNG formats
- Resize images on the fly
- Efficient image processing using GD library
- Easy to use and integrate with existing PHP applications

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- GD extension of PHP

## Installation

You can imgToWebp by composer or  
simply clone or download the repository and include files in your PHP application:

## Usage

Check the test directory. There are few examples how to use ir. 
To use imgToWebp, simply create a new `imgToWebp` object and call the `convert()` method with the source and destination paths:

You can use the following PHP code

```php
try {
    $imagePath = (new ImgConvertorService())
        ->setDirs($resizedImgDir, __DIR__)
        ->prepareImagePath();
    (new Response())->doImageOutput($imagePath);
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    // handle an error
}
```

Example for Laravel:

```php web.php

use Jukuan\ImgToWeb\Service\ImgConvertorService;
use Jukuan\ImgToWeb\Http\Response as ImgToWebResponse;

Route::get('img', function ()
{
    $sourceImgDir = public_path('');
    $resizedImgDir = public_path('resized');

    try {
        $imagePath = (new ImgConvertorService())
            ->setDirs($resizedImgDir, $sourceImgDir)
            ->prepareImagePath();
        (new ImgToWebResponse())->doImageOutput($imagePath);
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        abort(404);
    }
});
```

In the URL you can specify additional options, such as the width, the height, the extension of output file:
For example: `https://example.com/resizer/?img=static/uploads/guy.jpg&w=120`
